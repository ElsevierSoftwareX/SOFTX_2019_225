Couette

Our DNS code nsCouette is a highly scalable software tool to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow between differentially heated and independently rotating, concentric cylinders. The governing equations for the primitive variables are discretized in a cylindrical co-ordinate system using a Fourier-Galerkin ansatz for the azimuthal and the axial direction. High-order explicit finite differences are used in the only inhomogeneous (wall-normal) direction. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed in the axial direction. nsCouette is based on a pressure-poisson equation (PPE) formulation and a dynamic time-stepping with automatic CFL control. It is implemented in modern Fortran with a hybrid MPI-OpenMP parallelization scheme and thus designed to compute turbulent flows at high Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers. An additional GPU implementation (C-CUDA) for intermediate problem sizes and a basic version for turbulent pipe flow (nsPipe) are also provided.

## Installation

The source code can be easily downloaded from our git repository. Please read the included user guide for further detailed instructions.

```
# Download the repository
git clone https://github.com/dfeldmann/nsCouette
cd nsCouette
ls doc
```

To build the executable, a Makefile for a standard x86_64 Linux software stack with Intel, GNU or PGI compilers is provided. In general, the Makefile itself requires no editing by the user. Instead, all platform-specific settings can be fixed using the provided architecture files. You can find a variety of working examples for different systems in the respective directory. Have a look, copy the template which appears closest to your platform/situation and modify it accordingly.


```
ls ARCH/make.arch.*

# Build the code (e.g. with Intel compilers and MKL)
make ARCH=intel-mkl

# Build the code (more build options)
make ARCH=myPlatform CODE=<STD_CODE|TE_CODE> HDF5IO=<NO|YES> DEBUG=<NO|YES> 

# Build the user guide (requires pdflatex)
make doc
```

Dependencies and software requirements:

*  Compiler: A modern Fortran compiler which is OpenMP-3 compliant and additionally a corresponding C-compiler (for houskeeping tasks). Tested with ifort/icc 12-15 or later, PSXE2017, PSXE2018, GCC 4.7-4.9, PGI 14. For free software see: https://gcc.gnu.org/

*  MPI: An MPI library which supports thread-level MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED. Tested with Intel MPI 4.1 and higher, IBM PE 1.3 and higher. For free software see: http://www.open-mpi.de/

*  Linear algebra: A serial BLAS/LAPACK library. Tested with Intel MKL 11.x, OpenBLAS 0.2.14. Adapt $LIBLA and/or point environment variable $MKLROOT to an MKL installation. For free software see: http://www.openblas.net/ http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ http://www.netlib.org/

*  Fourier transforms: A serial but fully thread-safe FFTW3 installation or equivalent. Tested with FFTW 3.3 and MKL 11.1, earlier MKL versions will likely fail. Point environment variable $FFTW_HOME to a FFTW3 installation or select MKL (11.1 or later). For free software see: http://www.fftw.org 

*  Optional data output: An MPI-parallel HDF5 library installation. Tested with 1.8.9, 1.10.0-patch1. Point environment variable $HDF5_HOME to an suitable HDF5 installation or switch data output off by setting the external variable: make HDF5IO=NO. For free software see: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
