Justification for new reference data sets:

Two minor changes have been implemented in submit xxxxxxx, which both alter the
expected results of the reference runs. First, the subroutine output_torque has
been changed. The data written to the file Nusselt was not properly normalised.
Now the heat transfer is normalised with the purely conductive (laminar) heat
transfer as it should be. This changes the actual figures in the file
completely (only relevant for CODE=TE_CODE). Additionally, the friction Reynolds
number (Re_tau) at the inner and outer cylinder wall is now also computed and
written to file. This means the file torque now contains 5 instead of 3 data
columns. Second, the part of the code to prescribe initial conditions
(pulse_init, base_flow, perturb_init) has been changed substantially. The old
version is no longer needed/included, because it was neither divergence free
nor did it fulfil the no-slip boundary condition at the wall. Obviously, with
the new (different) initial conditions, the time series data of all quantities
in both, reference_run_1 and reference_run_2, will change (slightly). Both
changes should not affect the validation_run_1, which is started from a given
coeff file and the content of the file torque is not compared.
